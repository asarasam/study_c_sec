# C Programming Course (Beginner to Advanced)

Welcome to your fast-paced, structured C programming course focused on Windows.

## Structure
Each week includes:
- A `README.md` with topics and goals.
- A `practice/` folder where you can attempt exercises.
- A `solutions/` folder with reference solutions.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `.c` files using an editor like VS Code or Code::Blocks.
3. Compile and run using `gcc` or your IDE.
4. Compare with solutions after trying exercises.

## Compiler Setup for Windows
- Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
- Compile with: `gcc filename.c -o output.exe`
- Run: `./output.exe`

Happy coding!
